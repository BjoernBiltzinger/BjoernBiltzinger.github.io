# Professional Journey

Hi, I'm Björn Biltzinger—a passionate Software and Data Engineer at the intersection of cutting-edge technology and scientific innovation. My journey began with a deep-rooted curiosity for mathematics and natural sciences, which led me to pursue physics at the Technical University Munich in 2013.

## Academic Roots

My academic journey began with a deep fascination for physics, leading me to study at the Technical University Munich. During my time at the Max-Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics, I developed a strong background in data analysis and scientific research. Working primarily with Python and Stan, I focused on advanced data analysis techniques and led several scientific publications.

Throughout my PhD and postdoctoral research, my interests gradually shifted from pure physics towards the realms of software development and statistical analysis, reflecting my growing passion for technology and data-driven approaches.

## Current Endeavors

Since July 2023, I've been a Senior Software and Data Engineer at hema.to, where I'm part of an innovative team working on Leukemia diagnostics support through machine learning. My current work revolves around developing advanced MLOps pipelines and creating machine learning models to support diagnostician. 

# Beyond the Code

While data and algorithms fuel my professional life, I'm equally passionate about maintaining a balanced lifestyle:

## Sports
For me, sports are all about balance and mental well-being. I enjoy regular exercise as a way to decompress from work, typically engaging in moderate activities like jogging, hiking, cycling, or casual fitness routines. It's less about pushing limits and more about maintaining physical and mental health.

## Reading
My reading is a blend of curiosity and relaxation. I enjoy diving into a wide range of non-fiction books that explore everything from history and science to psychology and current affairs. Alongside non-fiction, I'm a fan of novels—particularly thrillers. My bookshelf is a eclectic mix that reflects my broad interests, always ready to explore new perspectives and learn something unexpected.

## Gaming
Video games are my go-to for relaxation. I love spending time playing casual multiplayer games with friends, enjoying the camaraderie and fun of shared gaming experiences without taking things too seriously.
