In 2013, I embarked on my physics studies at the Technical University of Munich, driven by my longstanding passion for mathematics and desire to understand the fundamental workings of our universe.

Throughout my bachelor's program, I gained comprehensive knowledge of physical phenomena ranging from classical to quantum physics, while developing strong foundations in advanced mathematics, particularly in linear algebra and analysis. My bachelor's thesis, in collaboration with the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics, focused on "Calculating the Hydrogen Transport in the Wall of a Future Fusion Reactor." This project involved simulating hydrogen diffusion mechanisms in fusion reactor walls to determine optimal operational cycles between plasma experiments. It marked my first experience developing production code, as I created an internal analysis tool using Mathematica.

During my master's program, I leveraged the curriculum's flexibility to specialize in astrophysics, an area that had long captivated my interest. This led to my master's thesis at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics, titled "Measuring the Cosmic Gamma-ray Background and Earth Albedo Spectrum with Fermi/GBM." The research involved developing a physical model to analyze background radiation detected by the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) space telescope, specifically focusing on measuring two primary background components: the Cosmic Gamma-ray Background and Earth Albedo Spectrum. For this project, I developed custom analysis software in Python, marking my first significant experience with the language in a professional context.

Key competencies developed during my stuides include:

* Advanced analytical and structured thinking
* Rapid adaptation to complex scientific concepts
* Effective collaboration with leading researchers in the field
* Development of computational models for real-world physics applications
