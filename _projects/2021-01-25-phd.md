Following my Master's degree, I continued my research journey as a PhD candidate in the same group at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics, building upon my previous work. During this period, I led the publication of several peer-reviewed scientific papers in astrophysics journals and made significant contributions to scientific software development. A key achievement was creating [PySPI](https://github.com/BjoernBiltzinger/pyspi/tree/master/pyspi), a new analysis tool for processing data from the SPectrometer on INTEGRAL (SPI), which is now publicly available on GitHub.
I also played an instrumental role in developing a [public-facing website](grb.mpe.mpg.de) that provides real-time publications of Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) localizations detected by the Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM). This work enhanced the accessibility of crucial astronomical data for the broader scientific community. Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, I was fortunate to present my research findings at three international conferences, allowing me to engage with the global astrophysics community and share insights from our cutting-edge work in gamma-ray astronomy.

Key competencies developed during my doctoral research include:

* Project leadership and scientific publication, demonstrated through leading multiple peer-reviewed papers and managing complex research initiatives
* Advanced software development, creating and maintaining production-level scientific tools used by the astrophysics community
* Scientific communication and presentation skills, honed through international conference presentations and collaborative research
* Real-time data analysis and visualization, implementing systems for immediate processing and publication of astronomical observations
