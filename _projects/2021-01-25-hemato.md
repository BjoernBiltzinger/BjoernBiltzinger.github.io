After completing my PhD, I joined [Hema.to](https://hema.to), an innovative Munich-based startup developing machine learning solutions for leukemia detection using flow cytometry. In my current role, I focus on developing sophisticated machine learning models that analyze raw cytometry data to classify individual cells and identify pathological patterns. Working in a dynamic startup environment has allowed me to expand my expertise across multiple domains. Beyond machine learning, I've made significant contributions to the company's technical infrastructure, co-creating our microservices messaging system, implementing MLOps pipelines with cloud computing, and developing our core library for database interactions and data processing.

Key competencies developed in my current role include:

* Machine learning expertise, specifically in developing and deploying models for medical diagnostic support
* Full-stack development capabilities, from backend systems to data processing pipelines
* Cloud computing and MLOps implementation, ensuring scalable and reliable model deployment
* Cross-functional collaboration, working effectively across technical and medical domains in a fast-paced startup environment
* System architecture design, demonstrated through the development of core infrastructure components and messaging systems
* Project management
